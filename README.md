# Graphic-recognition

Here are 8 functions (a1 - a8) based on Python following the below requirement
each function has its own main to test the result

1- Write a program to apply a 3x3 filter to an image (the original image should be gray).
Show the original image and the output image after applying the filter 

2- Write a program to change the value of each pixel to either black or white, then display the image. 
Write a program to count the number of black pixels in each symbol in each connected region

3- Write a program to do the convolution of an image with [1/3 1/3 1/3], and to do the convolution of the 
resultant image with[1/31/31/3]. Compare the results with applying 3x3 filters to the original image where 
each value in the filter is 1/9 

4- Write a program to scale down each symbol ln the image to certain dimensions then display the image 

5- Write a program to divide each symbol into 3x3 zones, find the ratio of black pixels to white pixels 
in each zone and return the feature vector. (This feature vector consists of 9 slots and can be used to describe the symbol) 

6- Use your program in 5 (or any other features) to store the descriptions of the 10 digits 0, 1, â€¦ 9 in a file 

7- Use one of the methods for measuring distance to test an unknown symbol and to recognize it 

8- Implement the graphic thinning operation using Zhang-Suen thinning algorithm
